# Android App Programming in Java â€” BMI Computation

This project is an Android application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs for height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds). The app consists of two activities: a main input activity and a result activity that displays the computed BMI and corresponding suggestions.

## Activities

### Main Activity
- Users can input height and weight.
- A button to compute the BMI.

### Result Activity
- Displays the computed BMI.
- Shows suggestions based on the BMI category.
- A button to go back to the main activity and reset inputs.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Android SDK
- XML (for UI design)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

## Future Enhancements
- Add metric unit support (kg/meters)
- Improve UI/UX with better styling
- Store user BMI history using SharedPreferences or a local database
