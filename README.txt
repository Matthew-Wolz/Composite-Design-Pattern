Company Structures Simulation with COMPOSITE Pattern

This project demonstrates the use of the Composite design pattern in Java to simulate a company's organizational structure. The goal is to create a hierarchy of departments, each capable of representing individual departments or groups of departments. This assignment consists of six Java files implementing the required functionality.

The assignment will incorporate the following classes for the Composite pattern:

1. Department.java (Interface)
2. FinancialDepartment.java (Leaf)
3. SalesDepartment.java (Leaf)
4. HRDepartment.java (Leaf)
5. HeadDepartment.java (Composite)
6. Main.java (Client)
